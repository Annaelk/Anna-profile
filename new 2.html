      <h2>üå∏ About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Anna Elkalay, 37 years old, and a proud mother of two daughters.</p>
      <p>I find joy in nature, the sea, camping, dancing, and quiet quality time that helps me reconnect with meaning and myself.</p>
      <p>My love for music led me to study and practice DJing one of my favorite personal expressions to this day.</p>
      <p>I strive for a healthy balance between high responsibility and a calm, focused mindset, while making space to recharge and stay inspired.</p>

      <h2>üöÄ Why I Chose QA</h2>

<h2> üåü Why Me  </h2>
<p> Building on the QA responsibilities I was entrusted with at work, I made a conscious decision to deepen my knowledge and invest in professional development.
Although my hands-on experience in QA began recently, it offered me valuable practical exposure that fueled my motivation to learn. I‚Äôve combined this real-world insight with formal training, which has helped me sharpen my skills and gain a solid foundation in software testing.
I bring dedication, initiative, and a strong ability to learn quickly‚Äîall of which make me a great fit for a growing QA environment.   </p>
